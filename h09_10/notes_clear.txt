Perl script was created.
Fixes: non-letters to underscore, letters to lower case.

Apriori was briefly overviewed, and useful options was found:
-t#      target type (default: s)
-tr      target type r: association rules
-s#      minimum support    of a     set/rule     (default: 10%)
-c#      minimum confidence of a     rule         (default: 80%)

Rule, for example:
D <- A B (50, 100)
means that:
    (A and B) is in 50% of rows, (>-s)
    D is in all rows where is (A and B), (>-c)

Top sets and rules was found.
Default filter parameters needed to be lowered to find rules.
